### Hello World 🌍

I am a Climate Physics Master Student at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Here, I am sharing a selection of the projects I worked on as part of my studies, often collaborating with other fellow students.

Besides to my own repositories, some of my projects can be found in the CLPHUU organization which I have pinned.
